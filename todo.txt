- optimizations
    - ignore week data vectors in both dimensions
    - optimize number of samples (as a prep for full 2D modes)
    - shift to pytorch
    - shift to cuda

- get mode picture at any place in the cavity (in both directions)
- see how picture depends on the pump power

- compare physical parameters reality vs. simulation 

- cavity building in calculator and using in other places
    - using Guassian Q parameter propogation
