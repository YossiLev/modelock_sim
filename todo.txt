- optimizations
    - ignore weak data vectors in both dimensions
    - optimize number of samples (as a prep for full 2D modes)
    - shift to pytorch
    - shift to cuda

- get mode picture at any place in the cavity (in both directions)
- see how picture depends on the pump power

- Auto seach for stable solution
    - Set scores for state estimation (pulse width, peak power, pulse power)
    - Automatic process
        - Select 1 parameter (dispersion, shift, kerr)
        - Select shift (like 0.1)
        - Select attempts (like 10 +/-)
        - Select counts (like 1000) also report count (like 100)
        - Select score (peak, width, power)
        - Record current state and for each attempt
            - restore saved beamType
            - 


- compare physical parameters reality vs. simulation 

V cavity building in calculator and using in other places
    V using Guassian Q parameter propogation

V recored revert
    V allow recording of current status
    V save parameteres of good runs

- diode simulation
    - RF analysis of pulse train
    - Store and recall parameters Set
    - Flexible siplay of graphs (full, part, none)
    - Calculate experimental actual parameters (maybe measure)
    - Add position of SA, OC and Gain
    - Next level
        - more gain positions (and maybe absorber positions)
