- optimizations
    - ignore weak data vectors in both dimensions
    - optimize number of samples (as a prep for full 2D modes)
    - shift to pytorch
    - shift to cuda

- get mode picture at any place in the cavity (in both directions)
- see how picture depends on the pump power

- Auto seach for stable solution
    - Set scores for state estimation (pulse width, peak power, pulse power)
    - Allow selection 

- compare physical parameters reality vs. simulation 

V cavity building in calculator and using in other places
    V using Guassian Q parameter propogation

V recored revert
    V allow recording of current status
    V save parameteres of good runs
